"This repository contains coursework solutions for Machine Learning and Time Series Forecasting tasks using R. It includes implementations of clustering algorithms on a dataset of white wine varieties and the application of a Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN) for exchange rate forecasting. The clustering part involves preprocessing, dimensionality reduction using PCA, and evaluating clustering performance metrics. The time series forecasting section focuses on autoregressive modeling techniques with thorough analysis using statistical indices. Each task is accompanied by detailed R scripts and comprehensive reports showcasing methodology, results, and discussions."
